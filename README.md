# Surfs_Up
Analysis Report
1.	The purpose of this analysis is to help me fulfill my newfound passion of surfing in Hawaii and eventually live there forever. So, to fulfill my new passion, I came up with the idea of opening a Surf and Shake shop, where I can sell surfboards and ice cream to locals, tourists, and of course, yourself. I team up with an investor who is willing to back me up to get the business started but he has a concern about the weather. Together, we decided to a weather analysis to see if the 
business will have a chance to succeed. 

2.	Result:

•	Looking at the table below, we can see that the minimum temperature in the month of June is just above 60 degrees and maximum is 85 degrees. Which in my opinion is a good temperature to attract the locals and tourists to go surf and enjoy a good flavor of ice cream.

•	There is not a significant difference in the temperature in the December from June. The difference is that in December temperature is a couple of degree lower compared to the June. Therefore, in December I would expect the same outcome as in June.

•	Another aspect worth to point out is the difference in the standard of deviation. In June the standard of deviation is lower, meaning that the temperature is relatively consistent. And in the December the standard of deviation is higher which mean that the temperature is not consistent.
Summary:
To summarize, in Oahu, Hawaii, the weather is pretty much the same from June through December with minimum temperatures above 60 degrees and maximum temperatures above 80 degrees. In that case, opening a Surf and Shake shop would not be a bad investment. I truly believe that the business is sustainable year-round, so I recommend W. Avy to go ahead and jump on board. To back up my conclusion, I did two more queries to see if there would be a different pattern. The two tables below show the 5 days consecutive of temperature for the months of June and December. As we can see the temperatures are almost the same.
